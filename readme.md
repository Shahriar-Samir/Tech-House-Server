If you want to test it on your local machine
- At first, you have to clone the server-side project repo, so you have to open a terminal in the directory where you want to clone the project.
- Give the command "git clone 'your repo clone link" in the terminal.
- Then you have to clone the client-side repo of this project and just like before clone it in that directory where the client repo has been cloned.
- After finishing all repos clone to the project directory and open the terminal.
- In your both client and server terminals write 'npm i' for installing dependencies.
- At last, give the command 'npm start' to the server side integrated terminal. Then you have to give the command 'npm run dev' in the client side terminal and go to the link 'http://localhost:5173', then you should see this web project running on your local machine.
